#  Max Kurian's chess career

**Age 4**

At age 4 my father introduced me to chess, I was just learning the basics of chess like how to move peices and the actual goal of the game. I didn't play the game that often when I was 4, it was a game that my father and I played sometimes on the weekend. I didn't have an offical rating at the time however, I would say I played like a 300 rated player.

**Age 5** 

When I was 5 I still played chess with my father however, I was beginning to stand a chance to my father every now and then I would beat him. I still played chess for fun nothing serious. I still didn't have a chess rating but I would say I played like a 400 since I was seeing more hanging peices on the board.
