#  Max Kurian's chess career

**Age 4**

At age 4 my father introduced me to chess, I was just learning the basics of chess like how to move peices and the actual goal of the game. I didn't play the game that often when I was 4. It was a game that my father and I played sometimes on the weekend. I didn't have an official rating at the time however, I would say I played like a 300 rated player.

**Age 5** 

When I was 5 I still played chess with my father however, I was beginning to stand a chance to my father every now and then I would beat him. I still played chess for fun nothing serious. I still didn't have a chess rating but I would say I played like a 400 since I was seeing more hanging peices on the board. 

**Age 6** 

At this age it was the first time that I would compete in a chess tournament in Adelaide. However I still wasn't good enough to win any tournaments yet. My rating at the time was around 450 at the time since I could see hanging pieces, nevertheless my unorthodox opening like D4 QD3 hindered my ability to play better games.

**Age 7** 

At 7 I think it was the age when everything clicked, I started to get coaching at my russian school. And I won my first tournament againist my chess class, I was awarded my first medal. To this day I still have that medal and I treasure it to this day. My rating at the time was around 500 since I was beginning to play normal openings like four knights and the ruy lopez. 

**Age 8**

This was the first time I was hit with an upsetting loss. I lost to one of the kids at the chess class and that caused me to get 2nd place. My rating was 550 at the time.

**Age 9** 

At age 9 I received my first offical chess rating of 600 and I started playing for my school at chess tournaments. 

**Age 10**

At age 10 my rating jumped to 1000 this is when I began to improve at a rapid pace. This is around the first time I attended the state finals.

**Age 11**

At age 11 I was around 1300 rating and I attended the national finals of Australia and I came 3rd for year 1-6 ( School Grade ). That was a pretty big deal for me and around this time I was beginning to receive coaching from a F.M Fide master.

**Age 12** 

At age 12 nothing happend and I was even thinking about quiting chess since I was making no progress howvever, I went on. 

**Age 13** 

At age 13 I beat my first Grandmaster Julia Ryjanova the postion was an equal end game with bishops and pawns however she ran out of time. My rating at this time is around 2000 and Beating masters become a common thing for me to do.
