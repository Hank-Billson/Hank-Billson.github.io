#  Max Kurian's chess career

**Age 4**

At age 4 my father introduced me to chess, I was just learning the basics of chess like how to move peices and the actual goal of the game. I didn't play the game that often when I was 4. It was a game that my father and I played sometimes on the weekend. I didn't have an official rating at the time however, I would say I played like a 300 rated player.

**Age 5** 

When I was 5 I still played chess with my father however, I was beginning to stand a chance to my father every now and then I would beat him. I still played chess for fun nothing serious. I still didn't have a chess rating but I would say I played like a 400 since I was seeing more hanging peices on the board. 

**Age 6** 

At this age it was the first time that I would compete in a chess tournament in Adelaide. However I still wasn't good enough to win any tournaments yet. My rating at the time was around 450 at the time since I could see hanging pieces, nevertheless my unorthodox opening like D4 QD3 hindered my ability to play better games.

**Age 7** 

At 7 I think it was the age when everything clicked, I started to get coaching at my russian school. And I won my first tournament againist my chess class, I was awarded my first medal. To this day I still have that medal and I treasure it to this day. My rating at the time was around 500 since I was beginning to play normal openings like four knights and the ruy lopez. 

**Age 8**

This was the first time I was hit with an upsetting loss. I lost to one of the kids at the chess class and that caused me to get 2nd place. My rating was 550 at the time.

**Age 9** 

At age 9 I received my first offical chess rating of 600 and I started playing for my school at chess tournaments. 

**Age 10**

At age 10 my rating jumped to 1000 this is when I began to improve at a rapid pace. This is around the first time I attended the state finals.
